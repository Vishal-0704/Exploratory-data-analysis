# Exploratory-data-analysis

## Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of a dataset containing information about used cars. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I examined various aspects of the dataset to uncover insights into factors influencing the prices of used cars. The analysis included visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation studies to understand the relationships between different features and the prices of cars. Key findings include the distribution of car prices, the impact of numeric and categorical features on price, and multivariate analysis highlighting correlations between features. These insights provide valuable information for pricing strategies, market analysis, and decision-making in the automotive industry.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and consists of detailed information about pre-owned cars, including their make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine specifications, fuel type, transmission type, owner type, seating capacity, location, and price.
I've uploaded the dataset as a CSV file in the GitHub repository's file section, enabling convenient access for anyone interested in replicating or extending the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
This project is implemented using Python programming language and leverages various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, including:

* Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and documentation
